* Wireframes:
    * [Main Page](docs/wireframes/index.png)
   
  There was some deviation from the original wireframes to improve the User Experience (UX).


### **Color Scheme:**
When deciding the color scheme, I wanted to go with something that gave an elegant appearance. For this reason, I selected a range of blue and gold's and used the following color grid created on [https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23f0f8ff%20(Alice%20Blue)%0D%0A%234b0082%20(Indigo)%0D%0A%23091c5d%20(Dark%20Blue)%0D%0A%23091c5d%20(Dark%20Blue)%0D%0A%234b0082%20(Indigo)%0D%0A%23000000%20(Black)%0D%0A%23ffffff%20(White)%0D%0A%23000000%20(Black)%0D%0Argba(0%2C%200%2C%200%2C%200.6)%20and%20rgba(0%2C%200%2C%200%2C%200.4)%20(Black%20with%20varying%20opacity)%0D%0A%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp) to check the contrast scores. Using this grid allowed me to ensure all text remained visible and the site was accessible to all.
